BUG Fix Notes:
2023-24-07 - Updated the function "GetRandomPiSeq" to strictly generate only 5 sequences of Pi decimal digits, preventing the occurrence of a seed index starting with 0 that would render the final sequence to be only 4 sequences.

Improvement Notes:
2024-21-04 - Removed the function "GetRandomPiSeq" and created the enhanced version of the function under the new class based on that name for a broader range of implementation for golden ration and pi function. Added the ability for the program to create a new list based on a user preference with the item on the list. The program will apply the random method based on phi and pi value to the list when shuffling.
